# angular-scss-cleaner-styles

This project showcases a simple and practical implementation of SCSS (Sass) using variables and mixins to create reusable and maintainable styles. It's built with Angular and demonstrates how to organize SCSS using a modular folder structure, while applying modern SCSS features like nesting, variables, and responsive mixins.

Features Covered

SCSS Variables: Centralized color palette, spacing units, font sizes, and breakpoints for consistent theming.
SCSS Mixins: Reusable mixins for responsive typography, flex/grid layouts, and utility classes.
Nesting: Organized styles using SCSS nesting syntax for better readability.
Modular Folder Structure: Includes folders like base, abstracts, and components for scalable styling.
Responsive Design: Mixin-powered responsiveness without repeating media queries.
