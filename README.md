# angular-scss-cleaner-styles

This project showcases a simple and practical implementation of SCSS (Sass) using variables and mixins to create reusable and maintainable styles. It's built with Angular and demonstrates how to organize SCSS using a modular folder structure, while applying modern SCSS features like nesting, variables, and responsive mixins.

## Features Covered

1. SCSS Variables: Centralized color palette, spacing units, font sizes, and breakpoints for consistent theming.
2. SCSS Mixins: Reusable mixins for responsive typography, flex/grid layouts, and utility classes.
3. Nesting: Organized styles using SCSS nesting syntax for better readability.
4. Modular Folder Structure: Includes folders like base, abstracts, and components for scalable styling.
5. Responsive Design: Mixin-powered responsiveness without repeating media queries.
